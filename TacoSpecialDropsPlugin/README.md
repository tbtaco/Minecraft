This plugin was created for an event where players kill mobs and have a chance of getting a raffle ticket.  They turn them in and have a chance to win free ranks.  On the server, we had another plugin that drops custom items when killing mobs so that wasn't anything new, but I wanted it to be a bit more custom than that.  In the end, they had a goal score to reach before a ticket drops and killing different mobs with different things and different situations would award different points towards their overall score.  Flying and killing them with an overpowered item for example would award very little points and actually takes away from their overall score, where killing harder mobs with weaker weapons gives more.  The idea was more work = more points, within reason.  The event lasted for a month and I would change this code everyday to keep them guessing.  They could check their score to see if their last action helped or hurt their points.
