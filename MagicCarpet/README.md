I created this plugin to practice writing in Java and try recreating a plugin I've seen in the past and hadn't seen in recent times.  It creates a "Magic Carpet" of sorts below the player by placing and breaking blocks very quickly and moving the center of this action with the player.  Jumping increases the height by 1 and crouching decreases the height by 1.  All this together makes for a neat and creative alternative to giving players creative flight.  A later edit lets players add their own designs by standing on what they want as a magic carpet, and running a command.  This plugin is still only meant as a test for admins only.
