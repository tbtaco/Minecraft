This repository has a few of my Minecraft plugins I wrote sometime in 2014 to 2018.  Overall I've created 25+ plugins myself and edited quite a few other plugins to fix bugs and achieve the desired functionality.  Each project in this folder will have it's own README.md to give some insight into what that plugin does, but I thought it'd be a good idea to add this general one to point out a common issue in all.  Color formatting in chat was a bit of an issue since it uses the "section sign" ยง so I use \u00a7_ a lot to do things with formatting.  Along with this, I also needed to use ANSI coloring for console output anytime the Bukkit/Spigot core isn't running, which looks very messy at times.  At one point I tried using variables to clean up the code but it didn't look much better than manually typing the section sign escape code everytime so I left things as is.
