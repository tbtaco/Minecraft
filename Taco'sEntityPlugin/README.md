This plugin was created to help remove unwanted entities around the map.  At the time, we were having issues with players spawning in several thousands of arrows, minecarts, and various mobs.  This lags the server and can add up over time.  This command lets a staff member quickly count nearby entities of all players and see where an issue may be located.  If needed, it can also be used to remove entities.  You can remove specific entities from around a specific player (within a specified radius) which greatly helps if someone is trying to crash the server.  While removing entities, you can also choose to zap each entity with lightning which can look really cool.  Great for wrapping up mob events or just getting the point across to a problem player that they need to stop what they are doing.
